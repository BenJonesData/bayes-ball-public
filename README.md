A Bayesian approach to predicting football match outcomes. This repository combines predictive modelling and Bayesian inference to uncover probabilistic insights into the data-generating processes behind the beautiful game.

## Data Sources
 - Match data was initially obtained from [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk).
 - Data is now being sourced [api-footabll.co.uk](https://dashboard.api-football.com) where we have a paid version of the API (Contact Charlie Young for the api key).
